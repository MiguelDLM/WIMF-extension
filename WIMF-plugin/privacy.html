  <h1>Privacy Policy for "Where is my fossil?" Extension</h1>
  <p>Last updated: February 2024</p>
  
  <h2>Information Collection</h2>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>The extension stores only your preferences (window size) locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This information never leaves your browser.</p>
  
  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The extension opens the Where is my fossil? website (https://migueldlm.github.io/Where-is-my-fossil/), which may have its own privacy policy.</p>
  
  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
